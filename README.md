In this workshop, we'll build a simple game apparatus with a 3D printed maze whose movement is controlled by your Android device in real time.  Our maze will be perched on top of a gimbal connected to a servo motor controlled by an Arduino, which will tilt the maze as per the incoming signal, with the objective of maneuvering a steel ball contained within to its destination.  This motion will be wirelessly controlled from an app (built using MIT App Inventor) which will sync up the device's orientation to the maze's.  All materials, including 3D printed parts, Arduinos and motors, will be provided.
